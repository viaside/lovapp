# lovapp-with-DataBase
😶‍🌫️
      Let me tell you about my first project. I decided to create applications using windows forms, 
			and connect my database to it. I decided to choose a social network theme for my application, 
			and called it LavApp. You can register in it by entering your name, return, gender and password, 
			then enter your profile, view all information about yourself, as well as your likes. 
			The main window of the application displays other users that you can like. 
			There is also an administrator menu (to enter, you need to enter the password "Admin"), 
			in it you can make changes to the user data. All data is stored in a database.
			This password is stored in another database. In this application, I used the database "PostgreSQL"
			
## Features
- Register.
